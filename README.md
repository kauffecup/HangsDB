Forever, Browserify, and Watchify all need to be installed globally (`npm
install ____ -g`). Install those, then run an `npm install`. Once you're all
set to start and run you do `npm run start`

Also make sure that there's a directory named `js` in the public folder before
you run `npm run start`. It isn't source controlled because we're ignoring the
`bundle.js` output from browserify.
